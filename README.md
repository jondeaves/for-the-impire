# For The IMPire
Guide the imp servants towards the ritual altar to revive the grand IMPress! A cute cartoon style arcade game, with fun and simple controls. Easy to learn and hard to master, can you revive the IMPress?

By tapping or clicking on the screen and dragging in order to aim. When you first click, or tap, a line will be drawn between the cursor and the nearest Imp which you can then guide towards the alter by releasing in the direction you wish it to travel.
